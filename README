The single greatest rope rig ever made for Maya

This is a simple rope rig for animation. Any length, any thickness and any twist all consolidated into an easy-to use rig. Import multiple versions and lock the heads and tails together for extended rope. Good for quick and easy modelling of pipes, wires, ropes and ropey effects - It can also be used to rig characters - import and use as rubber hose type arms and legs.
Future plans for this rig include recreating the file as a python procedure, that way you can generate ropes on the fly.
Version 2.0 with some "under the hood" improvements, increased speed and simplicity, file size is down to 70K. Main control object is: CTL. Use ropeEndA and ropeEndB to control the head and tail of the rope, and the 9 sub control objects to adjust your shape.
Version 2.1 - Overhaul and a complete rebuilt using paintFX - now you can scale any part of the rope.
 
Version 2.1.1 - revised some redundant code to reduce filesize by 9 K
